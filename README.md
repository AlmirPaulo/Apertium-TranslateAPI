## Credits and Thanks

[Apertium](https://github.com/apertium) is an Open Source project under the GNU GPL License. Apertium project is a plataform for developing rule-based machine translation systems and language technology. In my humble opinion, a bold project in a scenario where we have other several options, but this one dares to be open source. This API is my attempt of contribute with such a great project.
